react-hot-chat
==============

Frontend for a chat webapp. Uses [react-hot-boilerplate](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-boilerplate) as boilerplate.

### Usage

```
npm install
npm start
open http://localhost:3000
```

### Linting

This project includes React-friendly ESLint configuration.

```
npm run lint
```

### Using `0.0.0.0` as Host

You may want to change the host in `server.js` and `webpack.config.js` from `0.0.0.0` to `localhost` if you're having problems on Windows. This will disable access from the same WiFi network.
